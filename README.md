# Portfolio_Website

In this project, I will be creating my own portfolio website. I will be showcasing my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS up to this point. This is intended to be the core or root of my resume, almost an extension.

Future Work:
Edit CSS & HTML & JS
Make Responsive
Possible UI implementations

Fonts used are FontAwesome
